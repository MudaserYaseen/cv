                                progressive and innovative outlook. The College is planned to grow as a modern center of excellence for research 
                                and development in the fields of Engineering and Technology. Therefore, academic quality and spirit of excellence

                            <p style="text-align: justify">Realizing the urgent need for Technological and Engineering education in the region, the Government

                                very high caliber, capable of developing  indigenous technology to meet the growing demands of the new millennium.</p>
